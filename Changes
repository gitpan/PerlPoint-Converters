=Version 1.01  12/19/2001

* Many changes ...

* Better documentation: run a "make" in \C<./doc> and look into the \C<./doc/PPDOC>
  subdirectory.

* Changes now in PerlPoint format; after "make test" see file \C<./doc/Changes.htm>

* \B<PerlPoint::Converters> module (docu and some common functions for converters)

* more keywords which are replaced with option values:

>

* LABEL_NEXT

* LABEL_PREV

* LABEL_INDEX

* LABEL_CONTENTS

* SLIDE_PREFIX

* SLIDE_SUFFIX

* IMAGE_REF

<

* use "\C<IMAGE_REF/LOGO_IMAGE_FILENAME>" in style template files

* Bug fixed: bullet images were not always copied to the
  image directory

* \C<SLIDE_PREFIX> and \C<SLIDE_SUFFIX> used in frameset templates

* \B<Bundle::PerlPoint> for easy installation via CPAN shell:

 % perl -MCPAN -e shell
 \U<cpan\>> install Bundle::PerlPoint

* javascript navigation now in a separate file which is included by the
  navigation templates files

* javascript navigation now uses fixed names for the frames instead of
  numbers (is now more independant from actual frameset layout)

* \\E< xxx > now be possible in headlines

* test suite uses md5 checksums over generated files

* Tag \\URL{url=target_name} (similar to \\L{url=target_name}<target_name>)

= Version 0.11.01   08/02/2001

*  Cleaning up the test suite (was broken in 0.11, sorry!)

=Version 0.11   07/28/2001

*  Bullet bug fixed: When there was no bullet list in the PerlPoint input file
   then in the table of contents all bullets were standard HTML <LI> tags even
   if bullet images had been specified.

*  minor help text bug fixed (==item --> =item)

*  \\BOXCOLORS can now have the option set=default which restores box_bg_color and
   box_fg_color to their original values (which had been set by options ...)

*  Evaluation of style and main options: Now the main options overwrite options from
   style directories.

*  edit_cfg.pl script added

*  replace LOGO_IMAG_FILENAME with $OPT{image_ref}/$OPT{logo_image_filename}

*  use reasonalble defaults for  TOP_RIGHT_TXT etc. in styles. They can now be
   overwritten by main options.

*  --start_page=filename option (default: index.htm)

*  new keywords for Templates to be replaced: TOP_BGCOLOR, BOT_BGCOLOR, ...

*  FAQ, and reference manual started, Getting Started added.
   Documentation starts to improve :-)

=Version 0.10   06/16/2001

*  Nested tags bug fixed: it was not possible to use \\I, \\C inside 
   a link \\L tag.
   NOTE: It is still not possible to have an \\X tag in the body of
         a \\L tag!

*  Require \C<PerlPoint::Parser 0.3427>

*  Using new tag definition Module: \C<PerlPoint::Tags::HTML, PerlPoint::Tags::LaTeX>

*  Comment with version numbers in each created file

*  Bugfix: \\C, \\I, \\B, ... etc in headers was not correctly handled in former versions

*  --box_border option (for border width of text boxes)

*  --style_sheet option (still as an experiment; the behaviour of pp2html may change
   when style sheets are used)

*  die when wrong options have been specified

*  workaround for bug in TreeApplet: / was not possible in headers.
   now slashes are replaced with commas.

*  Empty fields in tables are now filled with "&nbsp;" so that the border will be
   displayed

*  --style_dir and --style options
   Support for styles (pre-defined sets of template and configuration files)

*  Bug with list indentation fixed: if the last item in a list is shifted (i.e.
   shift_level > 1) then the following text or block was indented. Now the
   shift_level is automatically reduced.

*  Some new Keywords which are replaced when templates are copied to the
   target directory: TOP_LEFT_TXT, TOP_MIDDLE_TXT, TOP_RIGHT_TXT,
   same for BASE, and LOGO_IMAGE_FILENAME;
   corresponding options: --top_left_txt, ...

*  Option --slide_md5: all filenames have the form 
    <slide_prefix><md5-checksum>.<slide_suffix>
*  Nested tables are now supported (see \C<PerlPoint::Parser> Docu)

*  Variables can now be used in template Files, see the ex_std_norm-top.tpl for an
   example: VAR(AUTHOR)

*  support of hierarchical anchor names for slide headers

*  pp2latex: fix for formatting of URLs included (thanks to Alex Sigel)




=Version 0.009   03/04/2001

*  require \C<PerlPoint::Parser 0.32>

*  new parameters --box_width and --filters for pp2html

*  URL_INDEX did point to last page, not to index (bug reported by
   Jeffrey Haemer)

*  Index entries format changed. Now they look like
      text ref1 [, ref2, ref3 ...]
   with "text" beeing the (multiple) index entry and ref1, ref2 ...
   beeing Hyperlinks as references. The text for the references is
   either the page number or the chapter number when the --num_headers
   option has been set.

*  Cleanup with templates. It has not been quite clear, what has to go
   to the HTML templates and what is generated by pp2html. For example
   the <BODY> line and the <HTML> tag. There were cases where the
   <HTML> header and the <BODY> line were duplicated, and a "cleanup"
   in version 0.008 even introduced a bug :-(
   So I decided to make it more clear. Please read the docu for
   pp2html (pp2html --help) and the ppdoc.pp file for more information
   about that. In short: <HTML>, <TITLE> and <BODY> lines are
   alway provided by pp2html (with options from outside passed through).
   HTML Template Files ONLY contain HTML text which is placed inside the
   <BODY>.

*  templates adapted

*  Continued numbered lists ( the ## paragraphs are now supported)

*  Shiftlevels are handled correctly

*  the \\BOXCOLOR and \\BOXTEXT Tags are obsolete now. Their syntax was
   not consistent: \\BOXCOLOR<green> has formerly been used to set the
   box color for code blocks. But normally all text in the tag body
   (between < and >) is part of the output and NOT a parameter to the
   tag. Tag parameters are specified in curly brackets. Therefore
   the new tag is:
   \\BOXCOLORS{bg=backgroundcolor fg=foregroundcolor}
   which replaces \\BOXCOLR<backgroundcolor> and \\BOXTEXT<foregroundcolor>

*  bugfix: escapes in code-blocks were inactive after embedded code

*  bugfix: URLs in pp2html were doubled in the output

*  workaround for TreeApplet Bug: Headers which contain a / are not allowed.
   Therefore all slashes are replaced with commas ...

*  Language parameter in \\EMBED{lang=html ...} is now caseinsensitive

*  Version information clarified: pp2html and pp2latex have individual version
   numbers (build numbers) and belong to a certain version of the 
   PerlPoint-Converters package.

*  Individual colors (foreground and background) for table of contents, index
   and normal slides, top and bottom templates: --bgcolor, --fgcolor, 
   --toc_bgcolor, --toc_fgcolor, --idx_bgcolor --idx_fgcolor
   --top_bgcolor, --top_fgcolor, --bot_bgcolor, --bot_fgcolor
   --top_linkcolor, --bot_linkcolor, --toc_linkcolor, --idx_linkcolor, ...

*  new options: --no_contents_indent, --no_contents_bullets
   This will prevent the table of contents from beeing indented by <UL> </UL> tags
   and the second option avoids bullets in front of each entry in the table of contents.

*  optional background images for normal slides, index and table of contents:
   --back_image, --toc_back_image, --idx_back_image
   --top_back_image, --bot_back_image

*  use Cwd instead of `pwd`

*  Images can now be part of an \\XREF tag!

*  \\IMAGE tag now supports BORDER=m option

*  XREF, PAGEREF and SECTIONREF now consider javascript navigation

*  --trans_table option re-implemented (had been part of an ancient version of pp2html)

*  different bullet images for different indentation levels
   --bullet option can be used more than once!

=Version 0.007   12/10/2000

*  First version for CPAN

*  Name of the package changed from `pp2xx' to `PerlPoint-Converters'.
   The reason was that the Parser package had to change its name from `PP-Package'
   to `PerlPoint-Package' when being moved to the CPAN. To make it clear that the
   two packages are closely related, I decided to use the new name.

   from Jochen Stenzel)
