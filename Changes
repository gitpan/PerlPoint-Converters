Revision history for PerlPoint-Converters.

Version 0.009   03/04/2001
-  require PerlPoint::Parser 0.32
-  new parameters --box_width and --filters for pp2html
-  URL_INDEX did point to last page, not to index (bug reported by
   Jeffrey Haemer)
-  Index entries format changed. Now they look like
      text ref1 [, ref2, ref3 ...]
   with "text" beeing the (multiple) index entry and ref1, ref2 ...
   beeing Hyperlinks as references. The text for the references is
   either the page number or the chapter number when the --num_headers
   option has been set.
-  Cleanup with templates. It has not been quite clear, what has to go
   to the HTML templates and what is generated by pp2html. For example
   the <BODY> line and the <HTML> tag. There were cases where the
   <HTML> header and the <BODY> line were duplicated, and a "cleanup"
   in version 0.008 even introduced a bug :-(
   So I decided to make it more clear. Please read the docu for
   pp2html (pp2html --help) and the ppdoc.pp file for more information
   about that. In short: <HTML>, <TITLE> and <BODY> lines are
   alway provided by pp2html (with options from outside passe through).
   HTML Template Files ONLY contain HTML text which is placed inside the
   <BODY>.
-  templates adapted
-  Continued numbered lists ( the ## paragraphs are now supported)
-  Shiftlevels are handled correctly
-  the \BOXCOLOR and \BOXTEXT Tags are obsolete now. Their syntax was
   not consistent: \BOXCOLOR<green> has formerly been used to set the
   box color for code blocks. But normally all text in the tag body
   (between < and >) is part of the output and NOT a parameter to the
   tag. Tag parameters are specified in curly brackets. Therefore
   the new tag is:
   \BOXCOLORS{bg=backgroundcolor fg=foregroundcolor}
   which replaces \BOXCOLR<backgroundcolor> and \BOXTEXT<foregroundcolor>
-  bugfix: escapes in code-blocks were inactive after embedded code
-  bugfix: URLs in pp2html were doubled in the output
-  workaround for TreeApplet Bug: Headers which contain a / are not allowed.
   Therefore all slashes are replaced with commas ...
-  Language parameter in \EMBED{lang=html ...} is now caseinsensitive
-  Version information clarified: pp2html and pp2latex have individual version
   numbers (build numbers) and belong to a certain version of the 
   PerlPoint-Converters package.
-  Individual colors (foreground and background) for table of contents, index
   and normal slides, top and bottom templates: --bgcolor, --fgcolor, 
   --toc_bgcolor, --toc_fgcolor, --idx_bgcolor --idx_fgcolor
   --top_bgcolor, --top_fgcolor, --bot_bgcolor, --bot_fgcolor
   --top_linkcolor, --bot_linkcolor, --toc_linkcolor, --idx_linkcolor, ...
-  new options: --no_contents_indent, --no_contents_bullets
   This will prevent the table of contents from beeing indented by <UL> </UL> tags
   and the second option avoids bullets in front of each entry in the table of contents.
-  optional background images for normal slides, index and table of contents:
   --back_image, --toc_back_image, --idx_back_image
   --top_back_image, --bot_back_image
-  use Cwd instead of `pwd`
-  Images can now be part of an \XREF tag!
-  \IMAGE tag now supports BORDER=m option
-  XREF, PAGEREF and SECTIONREF now consider javascript navigation
-  --trans_table option re-implemented (had been part of an ancient version of pp2html)
-  different bullet images for different indentation levels
   --bullet option can be used more than once!

   (Some earlier versions of the PerlPoint-Package needed perl5.6.0)

   o  Parameters for fgcolor, linkcolor, vlinkcolor, alinkcolor
   o  Parameters for cache usage: --cache, --cacheCleanup
   o  .cfg files adapted to new options

Version 0.007   12/10/2000
-  First version for CPAN
-  Name of the package changed from `pp2xx' to `PerlPoint-Converters'.
   The reason was that the Parser package had to change its name from `PP-Package'
   to `PerlPoint-Package' when being moved to the CPAN. To make it clear that the
   two packages are closely related, I decided to use the new name.
-  require 5.6.0 (because PerlPoint-Package-0.27 needs it, too)

-  pp2latex: rudimentary support of eps files:
   when you use \IMAGE{src="filename.gif"} a file named "filename.eps" will be
   included in the tex file (if it exists ... :-)
-  ppdoc.pp updated (\INCLUDE parser-paragraphs, parser-tags and parser-active-contents
   from Jochen Stenzel)
-  create the slide directory specified by --slide_dir as necessary
-  pp2latex: included first version of TABLE support (from Alexander Sigel)
-  --block_indent option for pp2html
-  --no_index option for pp2html

Version 0.005   10/19/2000

-  parameters "height" and "width" supported for \IMAGE tags
-  parameter "face" supported for \F tag
-  \TABLE tags supported
-  handle shift paragraphs > and <
-  Bugfix: if there was no index, the last page was not processed !!
