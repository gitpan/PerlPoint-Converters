Revision history for PerlPoint-Converters.

Version 0.007   12/10/2000
-  First version vor CPAN
-  Name of the package changed from `pp2xx' to `PerlPoint-Converters'.
   The reason was that the Parser package had to change its name from `PP-Package'
   to `PerlPoint-Package' when being moved to the CPAN. To make it clear that the
   two packages are closely related, I decided to use the new name.
-  require 5.6.0 (because PerlPoint-Package-0.27 needs it, too)
-  Option "--safe_opcodes"

-  \EMBED  \END_EMBED supported in pp2html
-  Templates changed (usage of karawane-50.gif)

   when you use \IMAGE{src="filename.gif"} a file named "filename.eps" will be
   included in the tex file (if it exists ... :-)
-  ppdoc.pp updated (\INCLUDE parser-paragraphs, parser-tags and parser-active-contents
   from Jochen Stenzel)
