Prerequisits
------------
This version needs Perl5.6.0
The pp2html program uses the following packages which are available on CPAN:

  Pod::Text
  Getopt::Long
  Getopt::ArgvFile
  PerlPoint::Parser 0.20
  PerlPoint::Backend
  PerlPoint::Constants
  
The TreeApplet classes are contained in the images subdirectory of this
distribution. For more information about the TreeApplet classes refer to
http://www.mcsoftware.com.au/java/TreeControl/treeControl.html


What's new in this version
--------------------------
This is version 0.007

Please refer to file "Changes"


Installation
------------
Just get the PerlPoint-Converters-<release>.tar.gz file and unpack it in a temp directory:

  tar zxvf PerlPoint-Converters-<release>.tar.gz 
  cd PerlPoint-Converters-<release>
  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install

  NOTE: make install does perhaps not what you expect it to do!
        It may be more advisable to install the scripts `pp2html' and `pp2latex'
        by hand into a directory in your $PATH.

The main script is `pp2html'. Try `pp2html --help | less' to get more information.
A test script `test.pl' is provided which runs the input file `ppdoc.pp'
four times through `pp2html' using four different configuration files.
The resulting HTML files are places in the `ex_*' subdirectories. These
test files contain some documentation for `pp2html'.

This script is also called for `make test'.

Test Cases
----------
The following examples/test cases are provided:
  ex_std_norm/     Standard HTML pages with no TreeApplet
  ex_std_tree/     Standard HTML pages with TreeApplet support
  ex_frm_norm/     Frame set with no TreeApplet
  ex_frm_tree/     Frame set with TreeApplet support

Issue the `make test' command to create the test samples.
Look at the results by opening the following files in your web browser
(Javascript must be enabled to look at the *tree* examples):

  ex_std_norm/page0000.htm
  ex_std_tree/page0000.htm
  ex_frm_norm/frame_set.html
  ex_frm_tree/frame_set.html

Credits

Thanks to Tom Christiansen for the idea and first implementation
of PerlPoint! And special thanks for his permission to use this
name for our new implementation.

Thanks to Jochen Stenzel who tested the first versions of pp2html
and supplied the powerful PerlPoint-Package which is the base of
this new implementation of pp2html.

Thanks to Stephen Riehm who shared his ideas of extensions for
the original software with us. The final language was basically
designed by a team of Jochen, him and me.

Thanks to Alex Sigel and Norbert Gruener who became our first
testers outside the team and helped us by their usage reports.
Special thanks to Alex for propagating the toolkit and his help
to publish the software!
